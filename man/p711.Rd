\title{Data for a limiting dilution assay}
\format{The data is a list with three components: \tabular{ll}{
\code{counts} \tab A list of length 12, each component of which is a vector
giving the square-root-transformed scintillation counts for a single plate.
\cr \code{cells} \tab A vector of length 12, giving the estimated number of
cells per well for each of the 12 plates. \cr \code{n} \tab Vector of length
4, giving the number of wells per group, which is the same for each plate. }}

\description{
This is data for a limiting dilution assay for a single patient, composed of
6 pairs of plates at 6 different cell concentrations.  The data is from the
same subject (at the same time) as \code{\link[=p713.2]{p713.2()}}.
